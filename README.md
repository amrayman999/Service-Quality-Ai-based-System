# Service-Quality-Ai-based-System
<h2>Service Quality Ai-based System is a cutting-edge platform designed to enhance customer service and support in various industries specifically in Arabic language. <br>
The main three tasks of the model: 
<ul> 
    <li>Topic classification(TC) </li>
    <li>Sentiment Analysis(SA)</li> 
    <li>Solution Generation</li></ul> 
However, we faced some challenges, difficulty accessing this sensitive information. To overcome this hurdle, web scraping is employed on governmental websites to gather relevant data related to citizen complaints.<br> 
And the evaluation metrics were measured based on f1-score metric<br>
<ul><li>95.8% for Topic Classifictio and 96% for Sentiment Analysis</li></ul>
<br>
The deployment process is applied using frontend and 
backend development with Django framework.
